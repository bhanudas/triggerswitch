Titanium weight, super duper basic Trigger Switch

Use this SFDX project and deploy into your org.  Not much to it, check out the 
Contact Trigger for how to implement.

Comes with Custom Metadata object to configure the switch (turn on and off in just two clicks) and 
two built in examples required to run the unit tests.

Contact Bhanudas Tanaka at bhanu@databasesherpa.com for any help with using it!
Or just drop me a line if you decide to implement this!

From the Non-Profit community at Salesforce.com with love
